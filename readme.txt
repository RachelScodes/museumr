Style:
	* Use // END SETUP to separate the 'requiring'
		sections from the rest of the code

To Do:
	[√] Fix models
		[√] pluralize model js file names
			- Seed links to artists.js, for example
			- Could just change seed.js instead
		[√] change model schema "years" and "birthYears"
			from String to Integer
	[√] Move routes to controllers
		[√] GET and POST for artists
		[ ] PUT and DELETE for artists
		[ ] GET and POST for paintings
		[ ] PUT and DELETE for paintings
	[√] Render views using handlebars
